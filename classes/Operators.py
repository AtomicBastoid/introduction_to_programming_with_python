# ## Arithmetic Operators

# a = 7
# b = 2

# # addition
# print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# # subtraction
# print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# # multiplication
# print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# # division
# print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# # floor division
# print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# # modulo
# print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# # a to the power b
# print ('Power: ', a ** b)

## Assignment Operators

# # assign 10 to a
# a = 10

# # assign 5 to b
# b = 5 

## Comparison Operators

a = 7

b = 2

# equal to operator
print('a == b =', a == b)

# not equal to operator
print('a != b =', a != b)

# greater than operator
print('a > b =', a > b)

# less than operator
print('a < b =', a < b)

# greater than or equal to operator
print('a >= b =', a >= b)

# less than or equal to operator
print('a <= b =', a <= b)

# ## Logical Operators

# # logical AND
# print(True and True) # True
# print(True and False) # False

# # logical OR
# print(True or False) # True

# # logical NOT
# print(not True) # False

# #Identity Operators

# x1 = 5
# y1 = 5
# x2 = 'Hello'
# y2 = 'Hello'

# print(x1 is not y1)  # prints False

# print(x2 is y2)  # prints True

# ## Membership Operators

# message = 'Hello world'

# # check if 'H' is present in message string
# print('H' in message)  # prints True

# # check if 'hello' is present in message string
# print('hello' not in message)  # prints True
# # Note: 'hello' is not in 'Hello world' due to case sensitivity
